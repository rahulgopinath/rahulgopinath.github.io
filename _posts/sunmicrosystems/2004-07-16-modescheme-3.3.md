Phew, the mod_scheme 3.3.a release is out, :D
I have fixed most of the bugs I know of, and written some docs on how to use it,
It is more of an Apache developers tool than a scheme development platform at
this stage, You can easily convert most Apache modules (handlers or filters) to
scheme or vice versa as it provides an almost one to one mapping with Apache
APIs,

## ToDo:

* More examples
* More documentation,
* Nice library ? (I keep putting this off.. )
