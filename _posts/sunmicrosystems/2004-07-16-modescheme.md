It seems that Tinyscheme has moved to 1.35 , so It is imperative that I update the mod_scheme,
now the things i need to do are,

* To fix the long broken Unix build of mod_scheme
* Get it updated to 1.35 of Tinyscheme (currently it is 1.33)
* Fix the problems with file handling
* Fix problem with input filters.

Secondly i also need to get the ns-scheme for SunOne Webserver cleaned up,
been down with fever for a few days, so i guess i got enough time to think it over.
