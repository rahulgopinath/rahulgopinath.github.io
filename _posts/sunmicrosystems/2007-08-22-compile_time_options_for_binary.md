e: compile time options for binary distribution of Squid
title: compile time options for binary distribution of Squid
---

As part of the Web Stack initiative, We are adding a binary distribution of  Squid to Solaris, and would like to know the communities opinion on the compilation options used by a majority of users.  
We have put together a comparison of compilation options in different binary distributions of squid [here](http://wikis.sun.com/display/WebStack/SquidCache). There is also a Poll underway [here](http://blogs.sun.com/blue/resource/squidpoll.html) to collect this information. If you are a user of Squid and Open Solaris, and you have a preference for the options to be used, Please come over and [vote](http://blogs.sun.com/blue/resource/squidpoll.html).
