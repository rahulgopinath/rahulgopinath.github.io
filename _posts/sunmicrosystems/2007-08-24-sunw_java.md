Am I the only one who finds [this](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/java_is_everywhere) absolutely brilliant?

Imagine a future sales that goes like this,  

Marketing guy from another company to a Customer: We have this absolutely fantastic product that will solve all problems for you,

Customer: Hmm ok, but how different is it from XXYY ?

Marketing guy: ... and it is in java too so it is cool...

Customer: wait a minute, But I saw JAVA ticker going down ...

Now, any company that wants to add that word to their PR will begin to wish for the JAVA ticker to start going up.

I mean, it can produce a class I effect with a [class III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_My_Name_with_an_S) stimulus.
