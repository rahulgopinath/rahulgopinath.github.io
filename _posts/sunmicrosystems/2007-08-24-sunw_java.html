                                        	Am I the only one who finds <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/java_is_everywhere">this</a> absolutely brilliant?
<p></p>
Imagine a future sales that goes like this,<br>
Marketing guy from another company to a Customer: We have this absolutely fantastic product that will solve all problems for you,
<p></p>
Customer: Hmm ok, but how different is it from XXYY ? 
<p></p>
Marketing guy: ... and it is in java too so it is cool...
<p></p>
Customer: wait a minute, But I saw JAVA ticker going down ...
<p></p>
Now, any company that wants to add that word to their PR will begin to wish
for the JAVA ticker to start going up.
<p></p>
I mean, it can produce a class I effect with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_My_Name_with_an_S">class III</a> stimulus.
