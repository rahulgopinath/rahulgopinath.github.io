Although mutation analysis is considered the best way to
evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite, hefty computational
cost often limits its use. To address this problem, various
mutation reduction strategies have been proposed, all seeking
to gain efficiency by reducing the number of mutants
while maintaining the representativeness of an exhaustive
mutation analysis. While research has focused on the
efficiency of reduction, the effectiveness of these strategies in
selecting representative mutants, and the limits in doing so
has not been investigated.

We investigate the practical limits to the effectiveness of
mutation reduction strategies, and provide a simple theoretical
framework for thinking about the absolute limits.
Our results show that the limit in effectiveness over random
sampling for real-world open source programs is 13.078%
(mean). Interestingly, there is no limit to the improvement
that can be made by addition of new mutation operators.

Given that this is the maximum that can be achieved with
perfect advance knowledge of mutation kills, what can be
practically achieved may be much worse. We conclude that
more effort should be focused on enhancing mutations than
removing operators in the id of selective mutation for
questionable benefit.
