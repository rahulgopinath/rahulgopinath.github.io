Software decay is a key concern for large, long lived software
projects. Systems degrade over time as design and implementation compromises
and exceptions pile up. However, there has been little research quantifying
this decay, or understanding how software projects deal with this issue. While
the best approach to improve the quality of a project is to spend time
on reducing both software defects (bugs) and addressing design issues
(refactoring), we find that design issues are frequently ignored in favor of
fixing defects. We find that design issues have a higher chance of being fixed
in the early stages of a project, and that efforts to correct these stall as
projects mature and code bases grow leading to a build-up of design problems.
From studying a large set of open source projects, our research suggests that
while core contributors tend to fix design issues more often than non-core
contributors, there is no difference once the relative quantity of commits
is accounted for.
