Regular expressions are widely used, but they are inherently hard to understand 
and (re)use, which is primarily due to the lack of abstraction mechanisms that 
causes regular expressions to grow large very quickly. The problems with 
understandability and usability are further compounded by the viscosity, 
redundancy, and terseness of the notation. As a consequence, many different 
regular expressions for the same problem are floating around, many of them 
erroneous, making it quite difficult to find and use the right regular 
expression for a particular problem. Due to the ubiquitous use of regular 
expressions, the lack of understandability and usability becomes a serious 
software engineering problem. In this paper we present a range of independent, 
complementary representations that can serve as explanations of regular 
expressions. We provide methods to compute those representations, and we 
describe how these methods and the constructed explanations can be employed in 
a variety of usage scenarios. In addition to aiding understanding, some of the 
representations can also help identify faults in regular expressions. Our 
evaluation shows that our methods are widely applicable and can thus have a 
significant impact in improving the practice of software engineering.
