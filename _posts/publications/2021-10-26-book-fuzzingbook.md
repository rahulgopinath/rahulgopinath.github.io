## About this Book

Welcome to "The Fuzzing Book"! Software has bugs, and catching bugs can involve 
lots of effort. This book addresses this problem by automating software 
testing, specifically by generating tests automatically. Recent years have seen 
the development of novel techniques that lead to dramatic improvements in test 
generation and software testing. They now are mature enough to be assembled in 
a book – even with executable code.
