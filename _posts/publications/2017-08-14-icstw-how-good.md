Software engineers primarily use two orthogonal means to reduce susceptibility to faults: software
testing and static type checking. While many strategies exist to evaluate the effectiveness of a
test suite in catching bugs, there are few that evaluate the effectiveness of type annotations in a
program. This problem is most relevant in the context of gradual or optional typing, where
programmers are free to choose which parts of a program to annotate and in what detail. Mutation
analysis is one strategy that has proven useful for measuring test suite effectiveness by emulating
potential software faults. We propose that mutation analysis can be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of type annotations too. We analyze mutants produced by the MutPy mutation framework
against both a test suite and against type-annotated programs. We show that, while mutation analysis
can be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of type annotations, we require stronger mutation
operators that target type information in programs to be an effective mutation analysis tool.
