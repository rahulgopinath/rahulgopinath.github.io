Language Model For Structured Input Generation

**By Trung Ma**

Supervised by:   Rahul Gopinath

#### Abstract

Fuzz testing has long been a vital technique in software security, typically used to un-
cover vulnerabilities by examining program actions using random or semi-structured input
generation. This thesis explores how machine learning, specifically pre-trained language
models, can be used as structured input generation for fuzz testing. Through the use
of language models, this research examines their capacity to internalize and generalize
complex inputs that still adhere to the established grammar.

This study evaluates machine learning-based fuzzing techniques on several key aspects:
input validity, code coverage, and structural diversity. By conducting experiments on
context-free grammars (CFGs) and structured data such as JSON, the study evaluates
the ability of models like GPT-2 to understand syntactical rules and produce structured
inputs.
