#### Bachelors Thesis

Differential Testing

#### Abstract

We live in a well-connected world in which almost any device is connected to the
internet and able to communicate with other devices. This exchange of
communication is based on standards like different protocols and data exchange
formats. One of these exchange formats is the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
JSON is a popular way to exchange data due to it being very efficient and
language independent. Douglas Crockford published the first specification of
JSON at the beginning of this millennium. Meanwhile, several specifications
describe how JSON should be parsed. However, developers often do not act
according to these specifications. As a result, JSON parser frequently parses
more inputs than they should.

This bachelor thesis investigates the consequences of the lax implementation of
the standards by evaluating various parser on diverse inputs. It generates and
optimizes invalid JSON by using well-known techniques of software testing.
Moreover, the thesis highlights that over 50% of the analyzed parsers are
error-prone to wrong JSON Arrays and JSON Objects. Whereas the structure of most
illegally parsed inputs is already known, it also points out some new designs.
Furthermore, it demonstrates that the problem is not restricted to specific
programming languages but is still a widely-spread problem.
