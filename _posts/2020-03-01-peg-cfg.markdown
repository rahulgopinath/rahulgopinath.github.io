Context free grammars were introduced as a formalism to specify context free languages by Chomsky and 
Schutzenberger[2]. It is a structural description of strings
that belong to a given language. Multiple  can exist that specify the same
context free language.  More importantly, a given context free grammar can also be used as a recognizer for a given context free language.
Numerous algorithms exist[9,4,7]
that when given a \cfg, can recognize whether any given string belongs to the corresponding
context free language. A recognizer checks whether a given string is in a given language. A parser recovers
the structure(s) of such a string if it is a member of such a language. A string may have
multiple structures if the grammar is ambiguous. Ruzzo[6] shows
how one can turn a recognizer into a parser (that recovers one parse of the string)
with $$O(log n)$$ effort where $$n$$ is the length of the string.

Ruzzo further shows that the *all-parses* problem (Generating
a convenient representation of a string parse from which all parses of the string can be
obtained.) is solvable in linear time (in terms of the length of input) only if Boolean
matrix multiplication of two $$n\times n$$ matrices can be done in $$O(n^2)$$ time.
Valient[8] showed that context free recognition of $$n$$ character strings can be carried
out at least as fast as multiplication of two $$n\times n$$ Boolean matrices.

Das et al.[3] shows that the lower bound for multiplication
of two $$n\times n$$ Boolean matrices is at least $$\Omega(n^3/2^{O(\sqrt{log n})})$$ which is
greater than $$O(n^2)$$.

Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) are an alternative means of specifying the membership
criteria for a language. It was formalized by Ford in 2004[5].
Aho et al.[1] showed that recognition using TDPL/GTPL which are equivalent
to PEGs in power can be done in $$O(n)$$ time where $$n$$ is the length of the input.

The question that one can now ask is, does there exist a context free language such that its recognition can be
achieved only in greater than $$O(n)$$ time. If such a language exist, then a PEG representation
cannot exist for that language.

Note that these results on parsing and recognition are all for context free grammars. So, can we translate our
above question to context free grammars? Say we have an arbitrary context free grammar. Say, the recognition using this 
context free grammar
can  be done in $$O(m)$$ time which is greater than $$O(n)$$ time using a BMM encoding. Can
there exist a different context free grammar that allows a *polynomially* faster recognition? If such a
context free grammar exists, then we can solve an arbitrary BMM problem by finding a context free grammar that will solve
it faster.
