#### <a id='gopinath2016code'></a>[Gopinath: _Code Coverage is a Strong Predictor of Test suite Effectiveness in the Real World_ GTAC, 2016]()

This talk is about the effectiveness of coverage as a technique for evaluating quality of test suite. We show the utility of coverage by considering its correlation with mutation score, and also show that coverage is a significant defence against bugs. Further, we also critique effectiveness of mutation score as a criteria for test suite quality.
